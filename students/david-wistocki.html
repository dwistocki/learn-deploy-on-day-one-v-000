              <h3>Biography</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>At the age of 12, I began my career as a DJ before attending college to study accounting and entrepreneurship. During my time in college, I built two public health organizations focused on nutrition that led to an overhaul of the campus dining facility's nutrient density. That momentum carried over to my business school studies when I formed a team of peers to build Ambrosia Global, a social enterprise to sell aquaponics systems as micro-franchises to base-of-the-pyramid communities. After a research trip to Haiti uncovered systemic governance issues, I stepped down from his position as CEO of Ambrosia Global to focus on conflict resolution and governance challenges with the Haiti Recovery and Development Company. That work led me to Washington, DC where I am currently working on research related to corruption, kleptocracy, and environmental crime with Sarah Chayes at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace while continuing to expand my 14-year career as an international DJ.</p>
